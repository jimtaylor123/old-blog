				<p>When I first got into development I had recently been made bankrupt. I had no money to spend on servers, courses or a new computer. I had a beat up windows PC that was about 4 years old running vista. It wasn't a good starting point.<br />
<br>
However, I've got to say that <strong>not having any money really forces you to discover what's out there for free</strong>. One exanple: I'm hosting this blog for free on github pages - how many people are wasting their money hosting their site on AWS S3 - you don't need it most of the time. You could even charge clients to host their pages on github pages for free - I'm sure there are plenty of agencies doing this. Not saying it's ethical, just saying it's possible ...<br />
<br>
So, here is another resource you might not know about - <strong>free domain names</strong>. <a href="https://www.freenom.com/">Freenom</a> will give you a COMPLETELY FREE domain name on one of several top level domains, namely .tk, .ga, .gq, .cf and .ml. As you can see below, not only are they free but they often have great namespaces available when compared to .com<br />
<br>
<img src="/assets/images/articles/freenom-mynextproject.png" alt="A list of 'mynextproject' domains available on freenom.com" title="Mynextproject available on freenom.com" width="100%" height="100%" /><br />
<br>
I'm amazed they are not more frequently used. But their use is subject to certain provisos. Here goes my summary of what I have learnt so far:</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2><strong>PROS</strong></h2>

<h3>They are free</h3>

<p>As in 100% completely free - no credit card sign up or anything.<br />
<br></p>

<h3>The name you are looking for is probably available</h3>

<p>As can be seen from the image above, even quite common domain choices should be available.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h3>Use them for your next big idea - avoid inadvertent domain squatting</h3>

<p>Avoid spending money aquiring domains that you never turn into a real project - just get a freenom to use while you build the app. When you are ready, buy the real thing. Stop wasting your money &#129297;</p>

<p><br></p>

<h3>Use them as a development/testing analogue to your production domain</h3>

<p>Need a development or testing environment for your application? Just use a freenom equivalent to keep things easy to remember but clearly seperate from your production environment. Example: your product is acmegloves.com? Register acmegloves.tk for dev and acmegloves.gq for testing. Easy for your team to remember and easy to use in test/deploy scripts.<br />
<br></p>

<h2><strong>CONS</strong></h2>

<h3>They are useless for email</h3>

<p>Because they are free they are routinely used by spammers. Most email providers (like zoho and gmail) will not allow you to use one of these domains. If you try to send emails using your own mail server they will probably go straight to spam.<br />
<br></p>

<h3>Famous names are not availble</h3>

<p>Due to fraud, forget being able to register google.tk or facebook.gq. This is really a good thing. You shouldn't be doing that.<br />
<br></p>

<h3>They are too weird and spammy for production</h3>

<p>Because of their dubious reputation, don't use them for anything professional, and your SEO results are probably going to suffer too...<br />
<br></p>

<h3>They need to be renewed</h3>

<p>You will need to renew them manually every so often, they can't be set up to auto renew like paid domains.<br />
<br></p>

<h3>They are subject to removal at any time</h3>

<p>If freenom think you are doing something naughty, or if your site just goes offline for a week and you don't notice, they will revoke the domain. You can usually go on the site and reclaim it, but there is the possibility someone else will "steal it", so don't rely on a freenom domain.<br />
<br></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Free domains are great for certain uses, and I don't know why more tutorials and developers don't use them. But they are definitly not worth using for production or anything you want to rely on.</p>
